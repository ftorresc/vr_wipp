Inclusion of chinese and japanese character set was attempted through https://msdf-bmfont.donmccurdy.com/ but ultimately abandoned due to the lack of support for multi-page bitmap fonts (https://github.com/donmccurdy/msdf-bmfont-web/issues/9). Creating a custom character set for each different sentence was also attempted but was deemed impractical.
