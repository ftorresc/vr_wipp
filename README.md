Inclusion of chinese and japanese character set was attempted through https://msdf-bmfont.donmccurdy.com/ but ultimately abandoned due to the lack of support for multi-page bitmap fonts (https://github.com/donmccurdy/msdf-bmfont-web/issues/9). Creating a custom character set for each different sentence was also attempted but was deemed impractical.

Although the project benefits from the mostly-black aesthetic, texture work was not able to be further developed because of GLTF texture requirements(elaborate)
